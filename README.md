# **turkey**: an Amazon Mechanical Turk turn-key segment tool.

**turkey** lets you easily create a web UI on Amazon Mechanical Turk to crowd-source image annotation data. Its main functions include:
* Customize the annotation modes and class labels on per-image basis
* Import previous annotations generated by either another human or an algorithm
* Zoom-in, zoom-out, delete, undo, reset
* (coming) Train a segmentation network in browser as the user annotates more data

## Configuring Amazon Turk to use turkey

Copy the contents of `Mturk.html` into the source code section when you create a custom HIT in the Amazon Turk Requester. After the HIT is created, simply **Publish Batch** with a CSV file of both image URIs and annotation modes that you provide. A sample CSV file may look like:

```
img_url,annotation_mode,classes,annotations
https://i.imgur.com/kcCSGTR.jpg, dot-polygon-link, house-person-car-dog, [{"class":"house","mode":"polygon","data":[[85,450],[41,524],[96,581],[163,531]]},{"class":"dog","mode":"polygon","data":[[246,461],[203,489],[268,500]]}]
https://i.imgur.com/2yOma1u.jpg, polygon, house-person-car-dog, []
```

Here, we allow the worker to use **Polygon**, **Link** and **Dot** modes for annotating the first image, but only the **Polygon** mode for the second. The class labels that the user can choose from are **house**, **person**, **car**, and **dog**. The first item in the list will be the default option. You can also import previous annotations by putting the correctly formatted json string into column "annotations".

## Testing without Turk
You can test the code before deploying it on MTurk by opening `localDemo.html` in your browser. This file is a lightweight wrapper that will load `MTurk.html` off GitHub, passing a sample image to it in the process.

## Unpacking data from .csv file
After the users annotate the images, Amazon Mechanical Turk provides a `.csv` file ready for downloading. `getResults.m` contains a sample MATLAB code that automatically reads in data from the file and displays the annotations.
